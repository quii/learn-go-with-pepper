# Learn Go with Pepper

I am currently writing a hamcrest inspired matcher library for Go [called Pepper](https://github.com/quii/pepper). 

I figured a good way to test it, would be to dogfood it, by working through my own course [learn go with tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests). 

It has already helped me iron out some usability issues, so im confident this will prove the worth of the library.
